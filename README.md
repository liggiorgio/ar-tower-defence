# AR Tower Defence
**AR Tower Defence** is an augmented-reality mobile game made with Unity to deliver a sample experience where AR is a core mechanic, not an optional feature.

I developed this app as the final project of the Augmented Reality class of the University of Milan.

Software adopted:
- Unity 2018.4.0f1 (game development)
- Blender 2.82 (object modeling, external renderer)
- GIMP 2.10 (sprite/texture editing)
- Audacity 2.3.2 (audio clip editing)

[Download](https://github.com/liggiorgio/ar-tower-defence/releases/download/v1.0.1/ARTD.apk) the game for free (requires Android 7.0+ with AR Core support).

## Gameplay overview
Players start by building a *Command Post*, which must defend from waves of incoming enemies, and then deploy turrets that attack enemies at sight. There's a 30-second intermission before each next wave, during which players can deploy more turrets and repair/upgrade existing ones, using currency earned while playing.

There's a total of 25 waves. Every 5th wave is a Boss Wave, and every 3rd consecutive wave is a Bonus Wave. Boss Waves include a randomised Boss amongst other enemies, Bonus Waves reward players if they accomplish the bonus objective.

## Main features
### Progression system
Every feat in the game awards experience points and this let players progress through 40 different ranks. Spending money during the game makes unit types progress as well, unlocking new upgrade levels.

### In-game currency
Players can earn and spend credits only while playing, since the game doesn't include IAP (In-App-Purchases), and money resets every time a new game starts.

### Rewards
Players can earn medals while playing if they meet the right conditions. There's a total of 9 unique medals.

### Game stats
The players' profile includes a detailed report of all feats performed while playing, such as total game time, progression percentage, number of enemies killed.

### Game options
Players can set up several options before starting to play, such as the starting wave, the game difficulty, and up to five game mutators. Such options alter enemies' behaviour as well as credits earned and points scored.

### Achievements and unlockable items
Some game options are not available from the beginning and must be unlocked. The game also includes eight achievements that players earn during game progression.

## Assets

All their work was used under the CC 3.0 or 4.0 License, unless it was in the CC0 public domain. None of the following creators endorses this project.
